This module provides the sort function to classify packages as STANDARD, SPECIAL, or REJECTED
based on their dimensions and mass.

Rules:
- A package is bulky if its volume (width x height x length) is greater than or equal to 1,000,000 cmÂ³
  or if any dimension is greater than or equal to 150 cm.
- A package is heavy if its mass is greater than or equal to 20 kg.
- Classification:
    - SPECIAL: Bulky or heavy
    - REJECTED: Bulky and heavy
    - STANDARD: Otherwise
